    <!--CSS DAY 1
    1) Difference between flex row and column.
    Flexbox was designed as a single dimensional layout, meaning that it deals with laying out items as a row or as a column - but not both at once. There is however the ability  to wrap flex items onto new lines, creating new rows if flex-direction is row and new columns if flex-direction is column.
    2)Explain inline, internal and external stylesheet.
    Inline CSS  : Requires the style attribute placed inside an HTML element.
    Internal CSS: Requires the <style> element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
    External CSS: Requires the <link> element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
    3)Justify-content allows you to what?
    Justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex-container, and the inline axis of a grid container.
    4)What is grid-template-columns used for?
    The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.
    5)What is the z-index in css?
    The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
    6)What is the difference between padding and margin?
    A margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.-->
